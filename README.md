#Hacking, The Matrix we live in.

**Description:**

We live in a Matrix, and i am going to show u how to hack this matrix to rule it and control it.

**What is Matrix?**

This is first question that u will ask after u come here. Well I suggest that you read this repo for some information 

`https://github.com/reconmaster/what_is_the_matrix`

**How Is it Possible?**

Next question is, is it even possible to hack The matrix?
The answer is, yes. Its possible to hack the Matrix.
Recconmaster explained one side of the coin, now i am going to explain the other one.

**Explination:**

The whole universe is coded by The God in a specific way. Means whole universe follows some specific patterns. Like you see that water follows a pattern. It evaportes from land and seas and reachs sky. There it turns into clouds and on the right time, it falls down in the form of Rain. And rain water again follows same pattern to form water bodies, then clouds and eventually rain again.
This was one of the many Examples. These patterns were created when the universe was created and they follow same way. These patterns will remain same till Doomz Day. 

**Whats the Logic?**

The Logic behind this is, these patterns will enver change, whatever happens, these patterns will remain same. Human activities do effect these patterns. As you can see it in the form of Climate Change. 
So, If our activites can cause negative effect on the patterns, then why cant we use these patterns for ourselves? 
Why cant we use a pattern to help us?
Why cant these patterns help us change the reality?
The Answer is, yes they can. All we need to do is understand the pattern to use it.

Alright, But how can we interact with the patterns?
This is what our curious mind asks us. The main point is, to know patterns from very basic level. 

**The basic Shapes:**

If you pay attention to the things around you, you will see that almost everything got something in common. Still its hard to know it. 
Let me explain this.
Everything in this universe is made up of three basic shapes:` 1: Circle` `2: Square` and `3: Triangle`.
Look around you. Observe objects around you. You will notice that everything around you is made up of these three shapes. Chair, table, fan, laptop, phone, etc.... All are made up of these three shapes.
Now lets take a look on it from atomic and sub atomic level.
